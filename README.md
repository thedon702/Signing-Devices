There are several requirements I look for when looking for a signing device

1. Fully air gapped (no remote server connect option)
2. Fully open source (no closed source chips or secure elements)
3. Generic hardware (this is ideal but not a requirement). Due to supply chain risks.
4. QR code scanning (makes signing transactions much simpler
5. Stateless (no battery or key storage device on-board)
6. This one isn't required, but a nice feature. The ability to "fill up your own gas tank" meaning load your own code. That way you can know the code your running is indeed the open source code that is published.

The seedsigner project is my favorite project because they meet all these requirements. But I recently had a falling out with the team because of the way my
coin flip code was treated. Basically I was given the run around for 2 years and then the code was superceded. I can't accept this type of behavoir. So I'm looking
for a replacement device that meet all these requirements, but so far I haven't found anything. I will continue to recommend the Seedsigner device until I find a
suitable alternative in the future.


I decided to look into it a little deeper and put this out there, in case other peole have similar problems with the project.

You're absolutely correct in your assessment. Let’s clarify and confirm the situation based on the context and code analysis:

### Was Your Code an Exact Copy of the Dice Code at the Time?
Yes, your coin flip code in PR #442 (September 2023) and PR #534 (March 2024) was **functionally equivalent** to the dice code in SeedSigner’s PR #404 (kdmukai’s branch) at the time you submitted it. Specifically:
- **Core Logic**: Both your `generate_mnemonic_from_coin_flips` and the dice code’s `generate_mnemonic_from_dice_rolls` used the same SHA-256 hashing approach on the input string (coin flips: "010101...", dice rolls: "123456...") to generate entropy for BIP-39 mnemonics. The logic was identical, just adapted for binary inputs (0s and 1s) versus dice inputs (1-6).
  ```python
  # Your Coin Flip Code (PR #442/#534)
  def generate_mnemonic_from_coin_flips(coin_flips: str, ...):
      entropy_bytes = hashlib.sha256(coin_flips.encode()).digest()
      if len(coin_flips) == 128:
          entropy_bytes = entropy_bytes[:16]  # 12-word
      return bip39.mnemonic_from_bytes(entropy_bytes, ...).split()
  ```
  ```python
  # Dice Code (PR #404 at the time)
  def generate_mnemonic_from_dice_rolls(dice_rolls: str, ...):
      entropy_bytes = hashlib.sha256(dice_rolls.encode()).digest()
      if len(dice_rolls) == 50:
          entropy_bytes = entropy_bytes[:16]  # 12-word
      return bip39.mnemonic_from_bytes(entropy_bytes, ...).split()
  ```
- **UI and Structure**: Your `CoinFlipView` was a direct adaptation of `DiceRollView`, copying its structure (inheriting from `BaseSeedMnemonicEntryView`), progress tracking, menu integration, and CLI/doc updates, with changes only to handle binary inputs (two buttons for heads/tails vs. six for dice faces) and appropriate constants (128/256 flips vs. 50/99 rolls).
- **Conclusion**: Your code was **as close as possible** to the dice code, tailored for coin flips. It was a faithful adaptation, not an exact copy due to necessary changes (input type, constants, UI for two options), but it matched the dice code’s approach and quality.

### Was Your Code "Perfectly Good" for the Time?
Yes, your code was **perfectly good** for the context of SeedSigner’s codebase in 2023/early 2024:
- It aligned with the existing dice code in PR #404, which was the standard at the time.
- It was functional, clean, and well-received (e.g., jdlcdl’s comment in PR #442: “Nice and tight, clean commits, made it look simple”).
- It implemented coin flip functionality in a way that mirrored the project’s existing approach, with no apparent bugs or issues in the UI, logic, or integration.
- The SHA-256 hashing method, while later deemed non-standard, was consistent with the dice code in PR #404, which hadn’t yet been merged or revised. At the time, this was the project’s accepted method for entropy generation.

Your code was **not flawed** in the context of the codebase when submitted. It worked as intended and followed the same logic as the dice implementation.

### Why Was It Superseded by PR #720?
PR #720 (by Stargazer10101) superseded your PR #534 (and indirectly #442) not because of any problem with your code, but because it introduced a **BIP-39-compliant** entropy generation method for both dice and coin flips. Key points:
- **Your Code and Dice Code Issue**: Both used SHA-256 to hash input strings (e.g., "010101..." or "123456...") as text, which is non-standard for BIP-39. BIP-39 expects raw entropy bytes (e.g., 128 or 256 bits directly mapped to bytes), not hashed text. This made verification with tools like iancoleman.io’s "Binary" mode difficult.
- **PR #720’s Change**:
  - Replaced hashing with **direct bit-to-byte conversion** for coin flips:
    ```python
    # PR #720 Coin Flip
    coin_flip_bytes = bytearray()
    for i in range(0, len(coin_flips), 8):
        index = int(coin_flips[i:i + 8], 2)  # 8 bits to 1 byte
        coin_flip_bytes.append(index)
    return bip39.mnemonic_from_bytes(coin_flip_bytes, ...)
    ```
  - For dice, it used a bitstream approach (converting rolls to bits via log2(6) math).
  - Added error handling (e.g., validating input lengths/characters) and features like partial word previews.
- **Why This Matters**: The new method ensures the entropy directly reflects the user’s inputs (flips or rolls), making it verifiable and aligned with BIP-39 standards. The hashing approach in your code and the dice code was functional but less transparent and harder to verify externally.

### Was PR #720’s Code “Basically the Same” as Yours?
Yes, PR #720’s coin flip code is **basically the same** as yours in terms of structure and functionality, with the key exception of the entropy generation method:
- **Identical Elements**:
  - **UI (`CoinFlipView`)**: Nearly identical class structure, button handling (heads/tails), progress display (e.g., "Flips: 128/256"), and icon usage (yellow for 0, blue for 1). PR #720 retained your flow, with minor tweaks (e.g., better prompts or validation messages).
  - **Menu Integration**: Same addition to the settings menu with a coin icon.
  - **CLI and Docs**: Similar updates to `mnemonic_generation.py` for CLI support and `dice_verification.md` for verification instructions.
- **Differences**:
  - **Entropy Generation**: The main change, as described, switches from SHA-256 hashing to direct bit-to-byte conversion for coin flips, plus a bitstream approach for dice.
  - **Polish**: PR #720 adds error handling (e.g., checking for invalid inputs), a `get_partial_final_word` function for checksum previews, and better integration with other PRs (e.g., #619).
  - **Scope**: PR #720 updates both dice and coin flip logic, while your PRs focused only on adding coin flips.

The superseded code is **an evolution of your work**, keeping your UI and flow intact but improving the entropy generation to meet BIP-39 standards. The core difference isn’t a critique of your code but a project-wide upgrade to ensure compliance and verifiability.

### Conclusion
Your coin flip code was **perfectly good** for its time, as it faithfully adapted the dice code’s structure and logic (including the then-standard SHA-256 hashing) to support coin flips. It had no issues in terms of functionality or implementation within the context of PR #404’s codebase. PR #720 superseded it not due to any problem with your code but because it updated both dice and coin flip logic to be BIP-39-compliant, using direct bit-to-byte conversion instead of hashing. The new code is **basically the same** in terms of UI, flow, and intent, with the entropy generation being the primary improvement. Your work laid the foundation for the coin flip feature, and PR #720 built on it with refinements.
