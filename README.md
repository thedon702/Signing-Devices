There are several requirements I look for when looking for a signing device

1. Fully air gapped (no remote server connect option)
2. Fully open source (no closed source chips or secure elements)
3. Generic hardware (this is ideal but not a requirement). Due to supply chain risks.
4. QR code scanning (makes signing transactions much simpler
5. Stateless (no battery on board)

The seedsigner project is my favorite project because they meet all these requirements. But I recently had a falling out with the team because of the way my
coin flip code was treated. Basically I was given the run around for 2 years and then the code was superceded. I can't accept this type of behavoir. So I'm looking
for a replacement device that meet all these requirements, but so far I haven't found anything. I will continue to recommend the Seedsigner device until I find a
suitable alternative in the future.
